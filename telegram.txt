# ## How to use:
# You must fill in your groups', channels' or people's ids
# to use Telegram integration.
#
# 1) Create a bot using @botfather bot in Telegram
# 2) Enter the bot token into ~/.november.conf file
# 3) Get somehow needed ids and enter them here like this one:

chats["me"]=123456789

# will be messaged using `november-helper telegram me`
#
# ## How to get the ids:
# - Use the web-version of telegram, the id will be visible in the address bar
# - Use a bot which tells you your id (you can search for them at http://storebot.me)

chats["group"]=123456789
